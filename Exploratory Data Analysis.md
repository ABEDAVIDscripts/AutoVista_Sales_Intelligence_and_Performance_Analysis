### SECTION B. Customer Segmentation Questions

<BR>

#### 1. Can customers be segmented by purchase value (e.g., high-, mid-, and low-tier spenders)? 

> Using Above 1,000,000 as High Spender; 500,000 - 999,999 as Mid Spender; Others Low Spender


```SQL

(SELECT customer_name, SUM(price) AS Price
FROM car_worksheet
GROUP BY customer_name)

	CASE
		WHEN Price >= 1000000 THEN 'High Spender'
		WHEN Price BETWEEN 500000 AND 999999 THEN 'Mid Spender'
		ELSE 'Low Spender'

FROM Gender_table
GROUP BY Gender, Distribution_count;
```

<BR>
<BR>

#### 3. What is the income range of customers buying specific models or brands? 

```SQL

	Annual_income,
	CASE
		WHEN Annual_income < 60000 THEN 'Low_Annual_Income'
		WHEN Annual_income BETWEEN 60000 AND 1000000 THEN 'AVG_Annual_Income'
		WHEN Annual_income > 1000000 THEN 'High_Annual_Income'
		ELSE 'Unkownn'
END AS Income_Bracket
FROM car_worksheet)

SELECT
