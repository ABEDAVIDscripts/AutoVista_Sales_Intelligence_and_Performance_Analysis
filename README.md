### Introduction:

The AutoVista Sales project was designed to convert raw automotive sales data into actionable business insights. The process began in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), where the dataset was meticulously cleaned to eliminate inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then conducted to identify key sales trends, product performance, and revenue patterns. These findings were translated into a dynamic Power BI dashboard that visualizes sales heatmap, revenue contribution and monthly trends. The final dashboard serves as a strategic tool for monitoring revenue performance and market behavior, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize sales outcomes.

### Business Objectives

The analysis was guided by key business questions:



Section A. Business Performance & Operational Metrics

- What is the total revenue from car sales? 
- Which car models generate the highest revenue? 
- Which dealer regions contributed most to revenue?
- What is the average revenue per customer? 
- Which dealerships achieved the most sales? 
- How do monthly car sales trend across the year? 
- Which months had the highest and lowest sales volumes? 
- Are there customers who made multiple purchases? 
- Are there customers who significantly reduced their purchase activity? 


Section B. Customer Segmentation Questions

- Can customers be segmented by purchase value (e.g., high-, mid-, and low-tier spenders)? 
- Whatâ€™s the gender-wise distribution of car buyers? 
- What is the income range of customers buying specific models or brands? 
- What is the average revenue per income bracket? 
- Can we identify potential premium customers based on purchase patterns or amounts? 




C. Visualization-Focused Questions
These guide your dashboard layout:

1. Sales performance by car brand or model (bar chart)? (from Model or Company, Price ($))

2. Revenue contribution by car body style (pie/donut chart)? (from Body Style, Price ($))

3. Monthly revenue trends (line chart)? (from Date, Price ($))

4. Heatmap of car model sales across months? (from Model, Date, Price ($))

5. Customer segmentation: scatter plot of income vs spending? (from Annual Income, Price ($) grouped by customer)

6. Top 10 best-selling car models? (from Model, sales volume or revenue)

7. What is the revenue contribution by dealer region?
